    <h2 class="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <div class="flex">
    <img src="images/selfie.png" alt="Picture of me"/>
    <p class="p-spacing"><b>I’m fascinated by mobile design and the experiences it can create for users. I enjoy using Figma and Illustrator to bring designs to life and express my creativity.</b><br>
      <br>I enjoy making things, and the concept of being able to design something that makes a difference in people’s every day lives is what drew me into UX.<br>
      <br>
      It wasn’t until I had recently finished my undergrad and moved back in with my grandparents in order to assist them that I really became acquainted with design.
      Simple things such as my grandfather being confused as to why he was seeing the Facebook app suddenly show up in his Windows 10 UI, as well as navigating Windows 10 in general.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="about-me-section2">
        <div class="quote">Design became important to me because I realized I could create and express my artistic side, making designs that people would use every day.</div>
        <div class="flex">
        <img src="images/logos.png" alt="My logo drafts"/>
        <p class="p-spacing">At the time I was feeling extremely miserable, dreading my original intentions to follow through with law school.
          It wasn’t until I was helping my grandmother try to understand something as simple as accessing photos on her iPhone one day that it dawned on me that perhaps there could be a way to make newer interfaces less confusing for my grandparents to understand; it was then that I knew with outstanding confidence that I wanted to be a designer.<br>
          <br>
          Design became important to me because I realized I could create and express my artistic side, making designs that people would use every day.
          I believe I can use design to make a difference in people’s lives to make their everyday tasks simple and efficient.</p>
